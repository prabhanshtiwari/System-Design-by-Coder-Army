# 🧠 What is Low-Level Design (LLD)?

> **LLD is the detailed design of software components, classes, and objects that together form the application.**

It involves:
- Designing **class structures**, **relationships**, and **interfaces**.
- Applying **object-oriented principles** (OOP: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction).
- Making decisions on **how different components interact** internally.
- Using **Design Patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer).
- Often involves **writing actual code** (or pseudocode) to describe how the system will work internally.

> ✅ **Prerequisite:** Knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and a programming language like **C++** is essential.

## 🆚 LLD vs DSA (With Story)

### Story:
- **Anurag** only knows DSA.
- **Maurya** knows both DSA and LLD.

> Both are asked to build a **video streaming app**.

- **Anurag** uses DSA to solve individual problems like sorting videos, using heaps to find trending videos, or a trie for autocomplete search.
- But he struggles when combining them into a working system — **no design patterns, tight coupling, poor scalability**.

- **Maurya** uses LLD to:
  - Divide responsibilities across classes like `Video`, `User`, `RecommendationEngine`.
  - Use design patterns for flexibility.
  - Maintain readable, scalable, testable code.

> 👉 **First LLD**, then **use DSA inside it** to solve specific problems.

## 🔍 What LLD Focuses On (Detailed)

### 1. **Scalability**
- Your design should **handle growth** — more users, more data.
- Example: Designing a **cache** interface for videos that can scale across servers.

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Code should be **easy to modify and extend**.
- New features should not break existing ones.
- Example: Adding a "shorts" feature should not break "movies" section — thanks to clear abstractions.

### 3. **Reusability**
- Code should follow **modular principles**.
- Easy to plug and play components.
- Example: A `NotificationService` class reused across `UserRegistration`, `Comment`, and `Like` modules.

## ❌ What is NOT LLD?

- LLD is **not just writing code** without design.
- LLD is **not solving algorithmic puzzles** — that’s DSA.
- LLD is **not about system architecture or infrastructure** — that’s HLD.
- LLD **doesn’t decide tech stack**, **databases**, or **how to deploy**.

---

## 🏗️ What is High-Level Design (HLD)?

> HLD is the **blueprint** of the system.

- Decides **what technologies** will be used:
  - Database (MySQL, MongoDB)
  - Backend (Node.js, Spring Boot)
  - Frontend (React, Angular)
  - Cloud Provider (AWS, GCP)

- Deals with **architecture**:
  - Microservices vs Monolith
  - Load balancing
  - API gateway
  - Caching strategies

- Covers **scaling** strategies:
  - Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
  - CDN usage

- In **HLD interviews**, we talk about **architecture, traffic handling, and cost**, not code.

## 🧠 Analogy: Human Body

- **DSA** = Brain  
  (solves problems, thinks logically)
- **LLD** = Skeleton  
  (defines internal structure, supports the system)
- **HLD** = Blueprint/Architecture Plan  
  (guides how everything should be built, where each organ goes)
