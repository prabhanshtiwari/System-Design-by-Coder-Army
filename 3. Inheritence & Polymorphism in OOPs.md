# Lecture 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

## 1. Inheritance

### 1.1 What is Inheritance?
- Real-world objects are often related in parent-child relationships.
- Example: Object A (Parent) and Object B (Child) share properties.
- In programming, this relationship is mimicked using Inheritance.

### 1.2 Real-Life Example: Car Hierarchy
#### Parent Class: Car (Generic)
- Common attributes:
  - Brand
  - Model
  - IsEngineOn
  - CurrentSpeed
- Common behaviors:
  - startEngine()
  - stopEngine()
  - accelerate()
  - brake()

#### Child Classes:
- **ManualCar** (inherits Car)
  - Specific attribute: CurrentGear
  - Specific behavior: shiftGear()
- **ElectricCar** (inherits Car)
  - Specific attribute: BatteryPercentage
  - Specific behavior: chargeBattery()

### 1.3 C++ Syntax
```cpp
class ManualCar : public Car { ... };
class ElectricCar : public Car { ... };
```
- `public` inheritance maintains access specifiers.
- `private` and `protected` alter accessibility.

### 1.4 Access Specifiers in Inheritance
- **public:**
  - Public members stay public.
  - Protected members stay protected.
- **protected:**
  - Public and protected members become protected.
- **private:**
  - All inherited members become private.
- Private members of parent class are never inherited.

## 2. Polymorphism

### 2.1 What is Polymorphism?
- Derived from: "Poly" (many) + "Morph" (forms) = many forms.
- One stimulus → different responses based on object/situation.

### 2.2 Two Real-Life Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** Different animals (Duck, Human, Tiger) all have a `run()` behavior, each performs it differently.
- **Scenario 2:** Same human `run()`s differently based on context (tired vs chased).

### 2.3 Types of Polymorphism in Programming:
- **Static Polymorphism** – Compile-time
  - Achieved via Method Overloading
- **Dynamic Polymorphism** – Runtime
  - Achieved via Method Overriding

---

## 3. Static Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

- Same method name, different parameter lists.
- Overloaded method is resolved at compile time.

### Example:
```cpp
class ManualCar {
    void accelerate(); // no parameter
    void accelerate(int speed); // with parameter
};
```

- Allows the same behavior to adapt based on passed arguments.

### Rules:
- **Method name:** Same
- **Return type:** Can be same or different (but not used for overloading)
- **Parameters:** Vary in number or type

---

## 4. Dynamic Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

- Same method signature is redefined in child classes.
- Achieved using virtual functions in C++.
- Resolved at runtime.

### Example:
```cpp
class Car {
    virtual void accelerate() = 0; // Abstract
};

class ManualCar : public Car {
    void accelerate() override; // Manual-specific logic
};

class ElectricCar : public Car {
    void accelerate() override; // Electric-specific logic
};
```

## 5. Combined Use of OOP Pillars

- Final code demonstrates:
  - **Abstraction** (Hiding implementation details)
  - **Encapsulation** (Private/protected members)
  - **Inheritance** (Manual/Electric inherit Car)
  - **Polymorphism** (Method overriding & overloading)

---

## Additional Concepts:

### Protected:
- Inaccessible outside class, but accessible in child class.

### Operator Overloading (Homework):
- **Concept asked as homework:**
  1. What is operator overloading?
  2. Why is it available in C++ but not in Java/Python?

---

## Conclusion & Practice

- Understanding OOPs is best done via real-world relatable examples.

### Practice suggestion:
- Modify/add features to existing car classes.

### Homework:
1. Define Operator Overloading.
2. Why is it not supported in Java/Python?
