A real world project has thousands of classes.
Managing these large number of classes is very difficult.

What are the principles/rules that must be followed to easily manage large number of classes?

We need to write code which is clean, understandable by others, and maintain an architecture.


Problems(if we don't follow design principles):
- Maintainability: Any new feature can be integrated easily without the bugs.
- Readability
- BUGS


To solve these problems, Design principles were created by Robert C Martin in 2000. 


SOLID Design Principles:
S - Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
O - Open-close principle(OCP)
L - Liskov Substitutuin Principle(LSP)
I - Interface segregation principle(ISP)
D - Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)




S: Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should have only one reason to change.
- A class should do only one thing.
- A class should have only one job or responsibility.


How to follow SRP?
- use composition

Note: Refer to code to understand this concept.


O: Open-close principle
- A class should be open for extension but close for modification.

Use this to follow  OCP:
- Abstraction
- Inheritence
- Polymorphism

Note: Refer to code to understand this concept.


L: Liskov Substitution principle
- Sub-classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
